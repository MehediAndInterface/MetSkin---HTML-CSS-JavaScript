## **Project Overview:**
MetSkin is a web-based platform designed to provide personalized skin care advice and facilitate access to professional dermatological care. Leveraging user-uploaded media (photos and videos) and advanced image analysis, MetSkin analyzes skin tones and identifies potential concerns. Based on this analysis, the platform offers tailored recommendations, including:
- **Customized Skin Care Tips and Routines:** Providing users with actionable advice on how to care for their specific skin type and address identified issues.
- **Product Recommendations:** Suggesting suitable skin care products, along with instructions on proper usage.
Medical Consultation Referral: When necessary, MetSkin will recommend a consultation with a qualified dermatologist.
- **Direct Doctor Appointment Booking:** Enabling users to seamlessly book appointments with recommended or preferred dermatologists directly through the platform.

## **Key Features (with Python/Django Backend Focus):**
- **User Media Upload:** Secure and user-friendly interface for uploading photos and videos of their skin. (Django handling file uploads and storage)
- **Skin Tone Analysis:** Utilizing image processing and AI algorithms (integrated via Python libraries like OpenCV, scikit-image, etc.) to analyze skin tone and identify potential skin concerns. (Backend processing and data handling)
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Generating tailored skin care tips, product suggestions, and medical referrals based on the analysis. (Django logic and database interactions)
- **Product Database:** Integrated database (MySQL, managed by Django models) of skin care products with detailed information and usage instructions. (Django ORM for database interaction)
- **Doctor Directory and Booking:** Comprehensive directory of dermatologists with online appointment booking functionality. (Django REST framework for API endpoints)
- **User Profile Management:** Secure user accounts with the ability to store skin analysis history and preferences. (Django's built-in authentication and user management)
- **Educational Resources:** Providing articles, videos, and other educational materials on skin care. (Django templates for rendering content)
- **Appointment Reminders:** Automated appointment reminders via email or SMS. (Django Celery for background tasks)
- **Secure Data Handling:** Ensuring the privacy and security of user data and uploaded media. (Django security best practices)

## **Target Audience:**
